## **Post Middleware & NodeMailer for Email Notifications**  
Today, I learned how to use **post middleware** in Mongoose to send email notifications after saving a file in the database using **NodeMailer**.  

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Post Middleware?**  
- `post` middleware in Mongoose runs **after** a document is saved in the database.  
- It allows us to execute additional logic **after saving data**, such as sending emails or logging activities.  

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Code**  

### **üìå `fileSchema.post("save", async function(doc) {...})`**  
- This middleware executes **after** a file is successfully saved in MongoDB.  
- It sends an email notification using **NodeMailer**.  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Breaking Down the Code**  

### **Step 1: Define the Post Middleware**  
```js
fileSchema.post("save", async function(doc) {
```
- This middleware is triggered whenever a document is saved in the **File** collection.  
- The `doc` parameter represents the saved document.  

---

### **Step 2: Log the Document (Optional)**  
```js
console.log("DOC", doc);
```
- Prints the saved document details in the console.  

---

### **Step 3: Create an Email Transporter**  
```js
let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: process.env.MAIL_HOST,
    auth: {
        user: process.env.MAIL_USER,
        pass: process.env.MAIL_PASS,
    },
});
```
- **Creates a transporter** using `nodemailer.createTransport()`.  
- Uses **environment variables** to store email credentials (`MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_USER`, `MAIL_PASS`).  
- This helps keep credentials secure.  

---

### **Step 4: Send an Email Notification**  
```js
let info = await transporter.sendMail({
    from: `CodeHelp - by Babbar`,
    to: doc.email,
    subject: "New File Uploaded on Cloudinary",
    html: `<h2>Hello Jee</h2> <p>File Uploaded View here: <a href="${doc.imageUrl}">${doc.imageUrl}</a> </p>`,
});
```
- **`to: doc.email`** ‚Üí Sends an email to the user who uploaded the file.  
- **`subject: "New File Uploaded on Cloudinary"`** ‚Üí Email subject line.  
- **`html: ...`** ‚Üí Email content containing a clickable link to view the uploaded file.  

---

### **Step 5: Log the Email Info (Optional)**  
```js
console.log("INFO", info);
```
- Prints email details (e.g., success or failure).  

---

### **Step 6: Handle Errors**  
```js
catch(error) {
    console.error(error);
}
```
- Catches and logs any errors in sending the email.
